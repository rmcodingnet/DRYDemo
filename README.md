## Things I didn't do
In the tutorial he creates another application and shows how to access the EmployeeProcesser class by referencing the dll. 

Near the end of the video he recreates the EmployeeProcessor class as a .NetStandard class library. Allowing it to be used in other platforms like say Unity for example. I have no need to do this personally so I didn't bother.
